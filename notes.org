- Use https://github.com/sloria/environs, it has lots of good features.
- Convert from dataclasses
- Use appdirs
- Load from json/yaml/toml/ini
- Load from click, generating click code
- Support t.Literal["foo"] and t.Union[t.Literal["foo", "bar"]] and enum.Enum for Choices with mm.validate.OneOf and click.Choice()
- Use namespaces in the metadata=
- How to set up env prefix and filenames for multireader? `MultiReader(readers=EnvReader(prefix='WEIRDPREFIX_'), name='normal')` and then have a method setting the prefix if there isn't one already set?

- Should the readers be here or should they be externally provided?
- Maybe provide an interface for readers
- Provide writers so you can see what config is necessary for each filetype
- Maybe readers and writers should be the same object
- Set default metadata keys for each loader
- Allow overriding the @type metadata with its container's field metadata?
- The CLI should be built from the marshmallow schema so it can validate on callback
- Get a desert snake logo
- Provide better error messages for parsing
- The CLI could show the default values that would be set based on the other loaders
- Multi could prevent its loaders from loading the defaults, and then add a final loader that loads the defaults. How to combine this with showing defaults in the CLI?
